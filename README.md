# Anonymous and Decentralized Freelance Work System: Freelance Society

## Abstract

Freelance Society is an in development open source project built on top of Ethereum that allows anyone connected to the internet to participate in a capitalist market. The system consists of three entities: managers, workers, and validators. Managers provide a public job with a financial reward open to be completed by anyone. Any worker in the network can participate and submit their work to complete the job. Validators verify the integrity of the work in accordance to the original specifications of the job. If the validators claim the work satisfies the job, then the worker is compensated with the reward, and otherwise is rejected an open to other contributions. The system aims to maintain economic incentives for all parties to act honestly and behave in ways that allow the process of labor to be exchanged for money.

## Introduction

One thing that can be learned through the 2020 pandemic is that many jobs can be completed purely through computers. Work can broadly be separated into four categories: gathering physical resources, manipulating physical resources, gathering information, and manipulating information. Although gathering and manipulating physical resources cannot easily be done through the internet, gathering and manipulating information can be communicated strictly through computers on the internet. This project hopes to improve the market of labor for these tasks through the internet.

Additionally, by the nature of this work that can be completed strictly through a computer, this project hopes to broaden the work opportunities to be completed by anyone. Since work can be submitted anonymously, all personal factors of the worker are independent from the labor-money exchange. The irrelevant factors include ethnicity, gender, political views, social status, sexual orientation, criminal status, economic status, college degree or lack thereof, age, disability status, country of residence, etc. Since any person or entity can submit work, the market of workers is as broad as possible. Any labor discrimination that exists in the physical world prevents economic opportunity that can be taken advantage of by this system. There is minimal barrier to entry, so any barriers of entry that exists in the physical world will repel workers from those jobs and attract labor towards this project. In cases where barriers to entry are formed by labor rejection due to nepotism, we should find a surplus of qualified workers that provide a more efficient labor system.

The system maintains an incentive system for users to work while promoting the product as publicly available. Open source has the upside that everyone can benefit from the product, but has the problem that there are typically no financial incentives to do so. Since this system requires validity checking of the product by anonymous users, it is infeasible to reliably maintain closed source secrets. But this also means that all work is publicly available which promotes an open source model while maintaining incentives.

## Tasks

Tasks are posted by managers on Ethereum through smart contracts. The task post has a reward(s), a link to the task specifications, the task specifications hash, the number of validators, the validator fee, the task deadline, and the evaluation bytes. The reward is an ETH amount that is deposited by the manager to the smart contract and withdrawn from the worker when the validators verify the integrity of the work. The task can have two options for completion: the first worker to submit a product that meets all of the specification earns the reward; or the worker that meets all specifications and obtains the highest score metric rated by validators among all valid submissions before the deadline earns the reward. These two methods allow the manager to choose the more important factor between a cheap and timely completion or a more expensive quality product. The link to the task specifications is some standard link to a resource that contains the data that make up the task specifications. The task specifications are stored off chain to reduce the amount of data that is expensive to store on the blockchain. The task specification hash is the hash of the task specifications file so the manager, worker, and validators can reliably agree on the task specification document. The number of validators is an odd number, three or above, that indicate the number of validators for the task. The validator fee indicates the buy-in cost for the worker to have their work verified by each validator. This cost is held upon the worker so they are incentivized to produce a quiality product to not waste money and effort for validators. The task deadline is time before which all worker submissions must precede. The evaluation bytes include the first bit, a flag to indicate between 0 a reward for the first valid submission; and 1 a reward for the best quality submission. The remaining bits represent a positive integer which indicate the number of boolean task specification requirements.

## Task Specifications

## The List

The list is a centralized document that displays the evaluation procedure of all tasks. A link to The List is contained on the Ethereum contract along with its hash value. Each task in the list contains an ID and a succinct procedure that defines whether a given product meets the criteria for completion. Each requirement of a task proposed by a manager must exclusively reference some evaluation procedure on The List. The List can be updated such that any evaluation procedure can be added, edited, or deleted. Any update must be approved by some significant number of validators. The update must be a unit change for it to be approved. Any procedures that are updated must have an incremental version number to prevent conflicts in evaluating the procedure. The List is entirely controlled by the validators since they are the ones evaluating the work, therfore they are incentivized to only allow evaluation procedures that are reliable and repeatable. Any evaluation metrics that allow for too much variabliity will cause disagreement among the validators and this disagreement may lead to and unfair deduction of financial rewards for rational validators. 

## Workers

Workers announce a response to a task on Ethereum through a smart contract. The response post has some standard link to a server, a link to the encrypted work, a hash of the work, and a list of key hashes. To submit the response, the worker deposits (number of validators) * (validator fee) ETH into the submission for the validators. The link allows validators to access a server endpoint hosted by the worker for the pool of validators to vote on the integrity of the work. The link to the encrypted work allows the validators and manager to have access to the encrypted data of the work. The hash of the work allows the manager and validators to reliably agree on the work data. The list of key hashes represent the hashes of secret keys that the selected validators use to prove they have the authority to vote on the work integrity.
